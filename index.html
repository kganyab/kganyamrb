<p style="color:black;">Skateboarding, form of recreation and sport, popular among youths, in which a person rides standing balanced on a
 small board mounted on wheels. Considered one of the so-called extreme sports, skateboarding as a professional sport
 boasts a range of competitions, including vertical and street-style events.Vertical skating(also called “vert”) 
 features aerial acrobatics performed in half-pipes that were originally built to emulate empty swimming pools.
 Street style features tricks performed in a real or simulated urban environment with stairs, rails, ledges, and
 other obstacles. Skateboarding has developed as a youth subculture that emphasizes creativity and individuality. 
 It is an alternative to mainstream team sports, which are more formally organized and largely controlled by adults.<P/>
